[LINE#258] Overall, fL showed the highest variability, with a SE in the afternoon (15%, t0.05,d = 14-75%), while fSOM showed the lowest SEs (5%, t0.05,d = 27 -48%).The partitioning obtained using the two end-member mixing model suggested that the autotrophic flux of 0.18 g CO2the larger fraction of RS, 56%, while the heterotrophic component flux of 0.15 g CO2 m-2 h-1accounted for the remaining 44% (Table 3).
