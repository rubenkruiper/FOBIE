[LINE#227]The sub-optimal design, i.e. the one with two bus bars which causes a higher series resistance and thus high ohmic losses, typically has a lower power at STC but may have a higher specific energy yield than those with three bus bars due to relatively higher efficiency at lower irradiances.
