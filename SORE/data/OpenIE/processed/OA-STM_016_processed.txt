[LINE#156+157+158+159]  Summary and conclusionsOur main conclusions are as follows:1.On 26 November 2011 we discovered a new bright spot on Uranus near 25N (named BS1) that grew increasingly bright near the time of discovery, suggesting a possible major brightening might be underway, perhaps competing with previous features observed in 1999, 2004, and 2005.2.Withthe help of observations from Gemini-North, Keck, Pic du Midi, and HST observatories, some before and some after the discovery date, we were able to track BS1 from 26 July through 16 December, and found it to be drifting at nearly a constant rate of 1.386/day westward at a mean latitude of 24.3 planetocentric until 13 November, after which its drift rate increased to 1.749/day westward.3.We discovered a second bright spot (named BS2) on November 10, when it was very close to BS1.

[LINE#163+164+165]  Capturing the results of this possible interaction was the aim of the TOO imaging carried out on 20, 25, and 29 December 2011.6.The large drift rate difference between BS1 and BS2 (7.7/day) in comparison with the difference expected from the latitudinal shear in the zonal wind profile (1.5/day) is quite large, and might be due to these features actually being companions to unseen vortices at somewhat different and more widely separated latitudes that do follow the zonal flow.7.BS1began to decline in brightness between October 26 and November 10, and was not clearly identifiable after 16 December, though subtle features were found that are consistent with survival through our last image on 29 December 2011, in which BS1 appears just north of a faint dark spot visible in F845M images, and has much more contrast in the F889N image taken on that date.8.The variable drift rates of both BS1 and BS2 suggest the possibility of long period oscillations in drift rates and latitudes, although latitudinal variability of the bright features is too large to confirm a simple advective model in which drift rate is proportional to latitude.9.BS2 was identifiable in 20 and 29 December TOO images, and in the 25 December image the feature seen may be either BS2 or the result of merging of BS1 and BS2.
