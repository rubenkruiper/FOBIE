[LINE#190] (SOC) stocks with management type (conventional versus organic)When the mixed effects model is restricted to the 0-10cm soil layer, the results for the best fitting models in both Costa Rica and Nicaragua include the coffee management (subplot) treatments and the initial C concentration as fixed effects with random slope effects of the replicate blocks and of main-plot treatments nested within the replicate blocks; AICs were 18.2 and 97.7 respectively (compared with 33.0 and 105.6 for models including main-plot treatment and subplot treatment as fixed effects and 37.0 and 99.8 for models based on main-plot treatments only).
[LINE#191] The contrasts within the ANOVA for 0-10cm soil depth SOC stock changes for Costa Rica further support the findings of the mixed effect models, showing a significantly greater increase in SOC stock in the organic than the conventional management treatments 3).The difference between management treatments is likely to be due to the application of organic fertilisers (at up to 11.25Mgha-1year-1), as no significant differences were found between these subplot treatments for total inputs of above-ground biomass to the soil in the form of senescent leaf litter and pruned material.
