[LINE#139]Today such self-limitation confines the diatoms to upwelling regions with high silicic acid concentrations.
[LINE#140]It is interesting to consider that this sequestration of silicic acid in the deep ocean, which has often facilitated shifts in the locus of opal deposition during the latter Cenozoic (Cortese et al., 2004) through changes in the location of silicic acid resupply to the surface and altered advection of deepwaters, began as far back as the Late Eocene.

[LINE#141]It is acknowledged that there is considerable complexity in the relationship between the diatoms, the biological carbon pump, and atmospheric pCO2.
[LINE#142]This is particularly well illustrated by a number of hypotheses invoking a role for diatoms in glacial interglacial CO2 cycles, predominantly through their ability to alter the partitioning of carbon between surface and deep ocean reservoirs (e.g. iron fertilisation, changes in the ratio of siliceous to calcareous primary producers, silicic acid leakage; e.g. Kohfeld and Ridgewell, 2009) and consequent effects on carbonate compensation.
