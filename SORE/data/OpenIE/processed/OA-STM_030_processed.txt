[LINE#126] Given the N2 sorption isotherm profiles and corresponding pore size distributions, it potentially can be inferred that there exists a degree of complimentary, self-organisation and arrangement between the starch gel and forming phase CdS phase during synthesis resulting firstly in an increase in the overall textural "quality" in the final porous products.
[LINE#127] Given the density of CdS (=4.83gcm-3) and that loading is based on 1.0g of the MS support, the actual pore volume of starch support for CdS1, can be estimated as >1.5cm3g-1; notably three times higher than the original MS control sample.

[LINE#129] In the context of the presented synthesis, the polysaccharide (i.e. here a predominantly amylose) gel, given its metastable hydrogen-bonded network, will be sensitive to alterations in the ionic potential of the aquagel system/pore walls in the gel phase (e.g. from salts (e.g. sodium acetate by-product) or the forming CdS phase), which may act to reorganise the network during the solvent exchange process.

[LINE#131+132]  The metastable polysaccharide "gel" may be expected to order itself to minimise surface energy in this dynamic system, with the pore dimensions presumably adapting to accommodate the introduction of a charged species (e.g. Cd2+).It is important to note that the divalent cation Cd2+ has an ionic radius of 0.097nm [22], which leads to a number of speculative points; (1) the diameter of the cation is smaller than the internal cavity of the amylose helix (double or single; ca. 0.4-1.0nm), which itself is presumably flexible under the synthesis conditions to accommodate introduction of the Cd2+ into its hydrophobic cavity (perhaps occupying micropores (Table 1); (2) the diameter is also approximately the same length as the (OH) H-bonding distances (i.e. 0.19-0.21nm)[23] between adjacent glucose residues that form the amylose helix (believed to be key to the formation of the porous polysaccharide phase); [15,24] consequently coordination of Cd2+ may stabilise an alternative metastable polysaccharide confirmation(s), gel state and in turn expanded surface properties.
