[LINE#733]Nevertheless, it is still worthwhile to equip forest trees with gene-based resistance to more than one herbicide, to allow herbicide rotations and to foil the possible spread of, say, glyphosate-resistant weed species from horticultural sites into forest plantations.
[LINE#734] In annual crops, there is a current effort to incorporate resistance to both glyphosate and the herbicide 2,4-D, to counter the emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds [191].An integrated approach will help mitigate problems associated with unwanted plants in managed forests.
