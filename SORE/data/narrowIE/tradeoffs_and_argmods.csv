JEB.1285,0,"Contrary to expectations , our study showed that daily exposure to a lower temperature had no effect on the bats ' learning abilities even though those bats spent less time with Tskin>30 ° C in comparison to bats kept at the higher temperature .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,1,"This suggests that for bats living under natural conditions , daily torpor would have no significant cognitive consequence with respect to relatively simple tasks .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,2,"Although the function of sleep is not fully understood , it is known that it plays an important role in the consolidation and retention of memory ( Stickgold , 2005 ) , while torpor is a process that allows energy conservation compared with resting ( Geiser , 2004 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,3,The two states of sleep and torpor are mutually exclusive .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,4,"When animals decrease their body temperature , the possibility of sleep is 


 suspended , and when they increase their body temperature to sleep , the costs of sustaining that high temperature increase ( Roth et al . , 2010 ; Trachsel et al . , 1991 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,5,We conservatively assumed that greater mouse - eared bats ( M. myotis ) are able to sleep when their skin temperature exceeds 30 ° C .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,6,"Djungarian hamsters spontaneously sleep when their body temperature rises above 20 ° C ( Palchykova et al . , 2002 ) after torpor .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,7,"Unfortunately , the influence of torpor on the sleeping pattern of bats is not known ( Zhao et al . , 2010 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,8,"Therefore , we can only speculate about the conditions necessary for bats to sleep and consolidate memory .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,9,Number of successful trials on both experimental days in the perch search experiment .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,10,"Between experimental sessions , bats were kept at 7 or 22 ° C .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]

JEB.1285,12,"Between experimental days , bats were exposed to 7 or 22 ° C .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,13,"Our experiments of exposure to low and high temperatures did not reveal differences in the speed of learning between treatment groups , although the period of time with Tskin>30 °",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,14,This indicates that the duration of torpor does not play a role ( or plays only a minor one ) in the impairment of memory consolidation of a simple task .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,15,"In other words , bats are able to avoid or minimize the conflict between energy conservation and memory consolidation .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,16,Torpor impairs object recognition in rodents in complex tasks but not in simple ones,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,17,"Bats in our tasks had to associate spatial elements with food or a safe place , which may be a more complicated task than simple object recognition .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,18,Such a task demands skills of association of spatial elements with rewards .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,19,"The extremely weak tendency for slower learning in bats kept at lower temperatures suggests that if torpor indeed affects learning abilities , it is happening at a very subtle level .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,20,The lack of clear cognitive effects of the decrease in body temperature could be explained by a bat 's life history .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,21,"Many bat species live in complex environments and knowledge about this environment is probably important in their long life ( Ruczynski and Siemers , 2011 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,22,"Therefore , behavioural and physiological mechanisms should have evolved in bats to minimize the negative effects of a trade-off between energy conservation and cognitive abilities .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,"['trade-off', 'energy conservation', 'trade-off', 'cognitive abilities']"
JEB.1285,23,Negative effects of torpor may be particularly minimized when learning is associated with a food reward ( which probably is the most common situation in nature ) .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,24,"This is because digestion prevents the bats from falling into torpor quickly ( Matheson et al . , 2010 ) and thus may provide a suitable amount of time for memory consolidation , therefore decreasing the potential effects of sleep deprivation by torpor .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,25,The subsequent fall into torpor might have no or only minimal effects on acquired skills or knowledge .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,26,"The idea that recent feeding delays the onset of torpor is further supported by the fact that in both treatment groups , animals that were in the perch search experiment , which were not fed after their training session , entered torpor more quickly and spent more time with Tskin below 30 ° C than bats in the food search experiment , which received food during training and experimental trails .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,27,"Nevertheless , in both treatment groups , the dynamics of Tskin followed natural patterns ( Dietz and Kalko , 2006 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,28,Bats were active with high body temperatures for several hours after training and only subsequently decreased their body temperatures .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,29,Our data suggest that even 1–2 h during which the bats keep their body temperature high is sufficient to consolidate memory about a simple task .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,30,"We conclude that under natural situations , negative effects of torpor on cognitive ability play only a marginal role , if any , in bats .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,31,"However , we suggest that starvation may amplify potential negative effects on cognitive processes in bats .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,32,"We argue on a more general level that although solving cognitive problems demands high brain temperatures , a period of decreased body temperature and inactivity does not necessarily impair cognitive processes that are actively underway before and after torpor .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,33,"Long - term memory is important for many animals in a variety of different contexts ( Roth et al . , 2010 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]

JEB.1285,35,"( Shettleworth , 2001 ; Stoddard et al . , 1991 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,36,"Storage of accurate memories is an active and costly process involving maintenance and repair of neural structures ( Dukas , 1999 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]

JEB.1285,38,"( Chancellor et al . , 2011 ; Roth and Pravosudov , 2009 ) ; for example , food - catching birds living in harsh climates have developed a larger hippocampus volume than those from milder areas , which may result in enhanced spatial memory and better survival in birds from harsh climates .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,39,"A memory is normally formed after repeated learning events ( Smid et al . , 2007 ) and sleep enhances this process ( Palchykova et al . , 2002 ; Roth et al . , 2010 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,40,"Sleep deprivation has negative effects on both memory consolidation [ the storage of initial memory representations into long - term memory by stabilization , enhancement and integration processes ( Stickgold , 2005 ) ] and retention",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,41,"( Graves et al . , 2003 ; Guan et al . , 2004 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,42,"Recently , an interesting conflict between energy conservation and sleep was discovered in hibernation and torpor using mammals ( for review , see Roth et al . , 2010 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,43,"Such mammals are able to decrease their body temperature to save energy during periods of food deficiency ( Geiser , 2008 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,44,"Although torpor , hibernation and sleep are all characterized by short or prolonged inactivity , they are very different physiological states ( Roth et al . , 2010 ) and are distinguished by duration , drop in body temperature and decrease of metabolic rate ( Geiser , 2004 ; Roth et al . , 2010 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,45,"Both rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS) are reduced during torpor and hibernation ( e.g. Deboer and Tobler , 1996 ; Deboer and Tobler , 2000 ; Deboer and Tobler , 2003 ; Millesi et al . , 2001 ; Trachsel et al . , 1991 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,46,Animals emerging from these states spend most of their time in sleep with brain activity typical for sleep - deprived animals,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,47,"This suggests that torpid or hibernating animals experience sleep deficiency ( Palchykova et al . , 2002 ; von der",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,48,"Ohe et al . , 2007 ) , which might lead to deficiencies in memory consolidation and retention .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,49,"The influence of torpor and hibernation on memory consolidation and retention has only been investigated in a handful of studies , primarily in rodents ( Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Mateo and Johnston , 2000 ; Millesi et al . , 2001 ; Palchykova et al . , 2006 )",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,50,"but also , in one recent study , in bats ( Ruczyński and Siemers , 2011 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,51,These studies tested the impact of hibernation on long - term memory and taken together provide conflicting results .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,52,"( Millesi et al . , 2001 ) provide evidence of memory loss ; specifically , spatial memory and memory of operant tasks were negatively affected by hibernation in European ground squirrels , Spermophilus citellus .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,53,"Social memory , in contrast to spatial memory , showed little to no impairment in European ground squirrels or in Belgin 's ground squirrels , Urocitellus beldingi ( Mateo and Johnston , 2000 ; Millesi et al . , 2001 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,54,"Contrary to the results from studies on such relatively short - lived rodents , studies on animals that live for longer and in complex environments , such as marmots and bats , suggested that their memory was not affected by hibernation at all ( Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Ruczyński and Siemers , 2011 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,55,"We ( Ruczyński and Siemers , 2011 ) postulated that the ability to protect long - term memory through hibernation depends on memory type and life history of the respective animals .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,56,We further suggested that long - lived animals and those living in complex environments have better protected memory than those that live relatively short lives and/or inhabit simple environments .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,57,Most of these previous studies addressed memory retention over long - term hibernation .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,58,"Here , we addressed a different question : is the consolidation ( shift from short- to long - term memory ) of newly acquired skills impaired by low body temperature ?",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,59,"When an animal moves into a hibernaculum , its memory is probably already consolidated .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,60,"However , animals that employ short - term torpor on a daily basis may well experience a trade-off between energy savings and memory consolidation , because the latter is expected to require a warm , active brain .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,"['trade-off', 'energy savings', 'trade-off', 'memory consolidation']"
JEB.1285,61,The process of memory consolidation invokes the establishment of new synapses and up- or down - regulation of existing synapses .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,62,"These complex cellular processes will require normothermic conditions for the biochemical machinery to work ( Palchykova et al . , 2006 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,63,"Furthermore , torpid animals are not able to sleep in a neurophysiologial sense , or may only be able to sleep at a reduced level .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,64,"As outlined above , this torpor - induced sleep deprivation should counteract memory consolidation .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,65,"Experiments on Djungarian hamsters , Phodopus sungorus , indeed indicate that torpor has a negative influence on memory consolidation and may impair object recognition ( Palchykova et al . , 2006 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,66,"In the poikilothermic snails Lymnaea stagnalis , the process of memory consolidation was also impaired by quick exposure to low temperatures ( Sugai et al . , 2007 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,67,These results indicate that the effect of decreasing brain temperature after training could be more pronounced on memory consolidation than on memory retention .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,68,Bats are a very interesting group of mammals in this respect .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,69,"Temperate zone bats , in particular , decrease energetic costs by falling into torpor on a daily basis even during the summer period ( Grinevitch et al . , 1995 ; Turbill et al . , 2003 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,70,"Memory retention in the vespertilionid bat Myotis myotis Borkhausen 1797 has previously been shown to be not affected by long - term hibernation ( Ruczyński and Siemers , 2011 ; Clarin et al . , 2014 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,71,"Here , we tested the influence of short - term daily torpor on memory consolidation in this species .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,72,Bats are also very long - lived animals .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,73,"Species of the genus Myotis live on average 14.9 years ( Barclay and Harder , 2003 ) and the reported age record for M. myotis in the wild is 37 years",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,74,"Learning , therefore , is probably crucially important in the behavioural ecology of bats ( Gaudet and Fenton , 1984 ; Page and Ryan , 2005 ; Ruczyński and Bartoń , 2012 ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,75,"As a result , bats could be especially affected by a trade-off between memory consolidation and energy savings using torpor .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,"['trade-off', 'memory consolidation']"
JEB.1285,76,"To test whether memory consolidation in bats is affected by the decrease in body temperature during daily torpor , we conducted two experiments , one requiring the bats to learn the location of food ( with a food reward ) and the other requiring them to learn the location of a dry perch ( without a food reward ) .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,77,"The former experiment required the bats to learn and remember a feeding site , while the latter required the bats to learn and remember an escape route from an uncomfortable situation .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,78,We tested whether learning performance depends on the duration of time during which bats stay at high body temperatures after training .,TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,79,"Based on the results from a rodent ( Palchykova et al . , 2006 ) and an invertebrate species ( Sugai et al . , 2007 ) , and because of the expected torpor - induced sleep deprivation , we hypothesized that animals which are able to stay longer at high body temperatures after training would have a greater chance to consolidate memory and could learn faster than those that decrease their body temperatures faster , deeper and for a longer period of time after training .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
JEB.1285,80,"Specifically , we expected individuals kept at 22 ° C between training and experimental sessions to show faster learning of their respective tasks over consecutive days in terms of the number of correct decisions and time to complete the task than individuals kept at 7 ° C between training and experimental sessions .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,[]
