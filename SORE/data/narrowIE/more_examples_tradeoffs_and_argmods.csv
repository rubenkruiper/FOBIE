JEB_1285,22,"Therefore , behavioural and physiological mechanisms should have evolved in bats to minimize the negative effects of a trade-off between energy conservation and cognitive abilities .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,"['trade-off', 'energy conservation', 'trade-off', 'cognitive abilities']"
JEB_1285,37+38,"  Therefore , animals may experience conflicts between the benefits and costs of memory retention ( the keeping of memory over prolonged periods of time)(Chancellor et al . , 2011 ; Roth and Pravosudov , 2009 ) ; for example , food - catching birds living in harsh climates have developed a larger hippocampus volume than those from milder areas , which may result in enhanced spatial memory and better survival in birds from harsh climates .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,"['conflicts', 'the benefits', 'conflicts', 'costs', 'memory retention', 'memory retention']"
JEB_1285,60,"However , animals that employ short - term torpor on a daily basis may well experience a trade-off between energy savings and memory consolidation , because the latter is expected to require a warm , active brain .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,"['trade-off', 'energy savings', 'trade-off', 'memory consolidation']"
JEB_1285,75,"As a result , bats could be especially affected by a trade-off between memory consolidation and energy savings using torpor .",TradeOffs with Arg-Modifiers,"['trade-off', 'memory consolidation']"
