            "text": "Bats, some species of rodents and some birds are able to save energy during the summer period by decreasing their body temperature and falling into torpor. Some studies indicate that torpor prevents sleeping and causes effects similar to sleep deprivation. Impairment of processes stabilizing memory slows down learning accuracy and speed. We conducted two experiments to test whether greater mouse-eared bats, Myotis myotis, which commonly use torpor during the summer period, experience a trade-off between energy savings and learning abilities. We compared learning speed and accuracy in bats that were exposed to low (7\u00b0C) and higher ambient temperatures (22\u00b0C) between training and experimental sessions. Tests were conducted in experiments with food reward (food search) and without food reward (perch search). Time spent with the skin temperature above 30\u00b0C was significantly longer for bats exposed to 22\u00b0C than for those exposed to 7\u00b0C, and longer in experiments with food reward than without food reward. We observed only a very weak tendency for better accuracy and shorter search times in bats exposed to 22\u00b0C than in those exposed to 7\u00b0C. Our data indicate that memory consolidation of bats under natural conditions is not affected by daily torpor when bats are in good condition and may therefore defend against a rapid fall into torpor. We suggest that homeostatic processes connected with the circadian rhythm allow protection of the consolidation of memory for relatively simple tasks despite time spent in torpor.",

                "Contrary to expectations, our study showed that daily exposure to a lower temperature had no effect on the bats' learning abilities even though those bats spent less time with Tskin>30\u00b0C in comparison to bats kept at the higher temperature. This suggests that for bats living under natural conditions, daily torpor would have no significant cognitive consequence with respect to relatively simple tasks.",
                "Although the function of sleep is not fully understood, it is known that it plays an important role in the consolidation and retention of memory (Stickgold, 2005), while torpor is a process that allows energy conservation compared with resting (Geiser, 2004). The two states of sleep and torpor are mutually exclusive. When animals decrease their body temperature, the possibility of sleep is\n\n\nsuspended, and when they increase their body temperature to sleep, the costs of sustaining that high temperature increase (Roth et al., 2010; Trachsel et al., 1991). We conservatively assumed that greater mouse-eared bats (M. myotis) are able to sleep when their skin temperature exceeds 30\u00b0C. Djungarian hamsters spontaneously sleep when their body temperature rises above 20\u00b0C (Palchykova et al., 2002) after torpor. Unfortunately, the influence of torpor on the sleeping pattern of bats is not known (Zhao et al., 2010). Therefore, we can only speculate about the conditions necessary for bats to sleep and consolidate memory.",

                "Our experiments of exposure to low and high temperatures did not reveal differences in the speed of learning between treatment groups, although the period of time with Tskin>30\u00b0C was significantly different. This indicates that the duration of torpor does not play a role (or plays only a minor one) in the impairment of memory consolidation of a simple task. In other words, bats are able to avoid or minimize the conflict between energy conservation and memory consolidation. Torpor impairs object recognition in rodents in complex tasks but not in simple ones (Palchykova et al., 2006). Bats in our tasks had to associate spatial elements with food or a safe place, which may be a more complicated task than simple object recognition. Such a task demands skills of association of spatial elements with rewards. The extremely weak tendency for slower learning in bats kept at lower temperatures suggests that if torpor indeed affects learning abilities, it is happening at a very subtle level.",
                "The lack of clear cognitive effects of the decrease in body temperature could be explained by a bat's life history. Many bat species live in complex environments and knowledge about this environment is probably important in their long life (Ruczynski and Siemers, 2011). Therefore, behavioural and physiological mechanisms should have evolved in bats to minimize the negative effects of a trade-off between energy conservation and cognitive abilities.",
                "Negative effects of torpor may be particularly minimized when learning is associated with a food reward (which probably is the most common situation in nature). This is because digestion prevents the bats from falling into torpor quickly (Matheson et al., 2010) and thus may provide a suitable amount of time for memory consolidation, therefore decreasing the potential effects of sleep deprivation by torpor. The subsequent fall into torpor might have no or only minimal effects on acquired skills or knowledge. The idea that recent feeding delays the onset of torpor is further supported by the fact that in both treatment groups, animals that were in the perch search experiment, which were not fed after their training session, entered torpor more quickly and spent more time with Tskin below 30\u00b0C than bats in the food search experiment, which received food during training and experimental trails. Nevertheless, in both treatment groups, the dynamics of Tskin followed natural patterns (Dietz and Kalko, 2006). Bats were active with high body temperatures for several hours after training and only subsequently decreased their body temperatures. Our data suggest that even 1\u20132 h during which the bats keep their body temperature high is sufficient to consolidate memory about a simple task.",
                "We conclude that under natural situations, negative effects of torpor on cognitive ability play only a marginal role, if any, in bats. However, we suggest that starvation may amplify potential negative effects on cognitive processes in bats. We argue on a more general level that although solving cognitive problems demands high brain temperatures, a period of decreased body temperature and inactivity does not necessarily impair cognitive processes that are actively underway before and after torpor."

                "Long-term memory is important for many animals in a variety of different contexts (Roth et al., 2010). Good memory allows for quick and effective rediscovering of food resources and hides, identification of conspecifics, etc. (Shettleworth, 2001; Stoddard et al., 1991). Storage of accurate memories is an active and costly process involving maintenance and repair of neural structures (Dukas, 1999). Therefore, animals may experience conflicts between the benefits and costs of memory retention (the keeping of memory over prolonged periods of time) (Chancellor et al., 2011; Roth and Pravosudov, 2009); for example, food-catching birds living in harsh climates have developed a larger hippocampus volume than those from milder areas, which may result in enhanced spatial memory and better survival in birds from harsh climates. A memory is normally formed after repeated learning events (Smid et al., 2007) and sleep enhances this process (Palchykova et al., 2002; Roth et al., 2010). Sleep deprivation has negative effects on both memory consolidation [the storage of initial memory representations into long-term memory by stabilization, enhancement and integration processes (Stickgold, 2005)] and retention (Graves et al., 2003; Guan et al., 2004).",
                "Recently, an interesting conflict between energy conservation and sleep was discovered in hibernation and torpor using mammals (for review, see Roth et al., 2010). Such mammals are able to decrease their body temperature to save energy during periods of food deficiency (Geiser, 2008). Although torpor, hibernation and sleep are all characterized by short or prolonged inactivity, they are very different physiological states (Roth et al., 2010) and are distinguished by duration, drop in body temperature and decrease of metabolic rate (Geiser, 2004; Roth et al., 2010). Both rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS) are reduced during torpor and hibernation (e.g. Deboer and Tobler, 1996; Deboer and Tobler, 2000; Deboer and Tobler, 2003; Millesi et al., 2001; Trachsel et al., 1991). Animals emerging from these states spend most of their time in sleep with brain activity typical for sleep-deprived animals (Palchykova et al., 2002). This suggests that torpid or hibernating animals experience sleep deficiency (Palchykova et al., 2002; von der Ohe et al., 2007), which might lead to deficiencies in memory consolidation and retention.",
                "The influence of torpor and hibernation on memory consolidation and retention has only been investigated in a handful of studies, primarily in rodents (Clemens et al., 2009; Mateo and Johnston, 2000; Millesi et al., 2001; Palchykova et al., 2006) but also, in one recent study, in bats (Ruczy\u0144ski and Siemers, 2011). These studies tested the impact of hibernation on long-term memory and taken together provide conflicting results. Millesi et al. (Millesi et al., 2001) provide evidence of memory loss; specifically, spatial memory and memory of operant tasks were negatively affected by hibernation in European ground squirrels, Spermophilus citellus. Social memory, in contrast to spatial memory, showed little to no impairment in European ground squirrels or in Belgin's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi (Mateo and Johnston, 2000; Millesi et al., 2001). Contrary to the results from studies on such relatively short-lived rodents, studies on animals that live for longer and in complex environments, such as marmots and bats, suggested that their memory was not affected by hibernation at all (Clemens et al., 2009; Ruczy\u0144ski and Siemers, 2011). We (Ruczy\u0144ski and Siemers, 2011) postulated that the ability to protect long-term memory through hibernation depends on memory type and life history of the respective animals. We further suggested that long-lived animals and those living in complex environments have better protected memory than those that live relatively short lives and/or inhabit simple environments.",
                "Most of these previous studies addressed memory retention over long-term hibernation. Here, we addressed a different question: is the consolidation (shift from short- to long-term memory) of newly acquired skills impaired by low body temperature? When an animal moves into a hibernaculum, its memory is probably already consolidated. However, animals that employ short-term torpor on a daily basis may well experience a trade-off between energy savings and memory consolidation, because the latter is expected to require a warm, active brain. The process of memory consolidation invokes the establishment of new synapses and up- or down-regulation of existing synapses. These complex cellular processes will require normothermic conditions for the biochemical machinery to work (Palchykova et al., 2006). Furthermore, torpid animals are not able to sleep in a neurophysiologial sense, or may only be able to sleep at a reduced level. As outlined above, this torpor-induced sleep deprivation should counteract memory consolidation. Experiments on Djungarian hamsters, Phodopus sungorus, indeed indicate that torpor has a negative influence on memory consolidation and may impair object recognition (Palchykova et al., 2006). In the poikilothermic snails Lymnaea stagnalis, the process of memory consolidation was also impaired by quick exposure to low temperatures (Sugai et al., 2007). These results indicate that the effect of decreasing brain temperature after training could be more pronounced on memory consolidation than on memory retention.",
                "Bats are a very interesting group of mammals in this respect. Temperate zone bats, in particular, decrease energetic costs by falling into torpor on a daily basis even during the summer period (Grinevitch et al., 1995; Turbill et al., 2003). Memory retention in the vespertilionid bat Myotis myotis Borkhausen 1797 has previously been shown to be not affected by long-term hibernation (Ruczy\u0144ski and Siemers, 2011; Clarin et al., 2014). Here, we tested the influence of short-term daily torpor on memory consolidation in this species.",
                "Bats are also very long-lived animals. Species of the genus Myotis live on average 14.9 years (Barclay and Harder, 2003) and the reported age record for M. myotis in the wild is 37 years (Gaisler et al., 2003). Learning, therefore, is probably crucially important in the behavioural ecology of bats (Gaudet and Fenton, 1984; Page and Ryan, 2005; Ruczy\u0144ski and Barto\u0144, 2012). As a result, bats could be especially affected by a trade-off between memory consolidation and energy savings using torpor.",
                "To test whether memory consolidation in bats is affected by the decrease in body temperature during daily torpor, we conducted two experiments, one requiring the bats to learn the location of food (with a food reward) and the other requiring them to learn the location of a dry perch (without a food reward). The former experiment required the bats to learn and remember a feeding site, while the latter required the bats to learn and remember an escape route from an uncomfortable situation. We tested whether learning performance depends on the duration of time during which bats stay at high body temperatures after training. Based on the results from a rodent (Palchykova et al., 2006) and an invertebrate species (Sugai et al., 2007), and because of the expected torpor-induced sleep deprivation, we hypothesized that animals which are able to stay longer at high body temperatures after training would have a greater chance to consolidate memory and could learn faster than those that decrease their body temperatures faster, deeper and for a longer period of time after training. Specifically, we expected individuals kept at 22\u00b0C between training and experimental sessions to show faster learning of their respective tasks over consecutive days in terms of the number of correct decisions and time to complete the task than individuals kept at 7\u00b0C between training and experimental sessions."
